<P><strong>Mercedes-Benz </strong> commonly referred to simply as Mercedes and occasionally as Benz,
     is a German luxury and commercial vehicle brand that was founded in <B>1926.</B>
      Mercedes-Benz AG <i>(a subsidiary of the Mercedes-Benz Group, established in 2019)</i> is based in Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany.
       Mercedes-Benz AG manufactures luxury vehicles and light commercial vehicles, all branded under the Mercedes-Benz name. 
       From November <b>2019</b> onwards,
        the production of Mercedes-Benz-branded heavy commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) has been managed by Daimler Truck,
         which separated from the Mercedes-Benz Group to form an independent entity at the end of 2021.
    In <b>2018</b>, Mercedes-Benz became the worlds largest premium vehicle brand, with a sales volume of <i>2.31</i> million passenger cars.
    The roots of the brand trace back to the 1901 Mercedes by Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft and the 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen by Carl Benz,
     which is widely recognized as the first automobile powered by an internal combustion engine. The brands slogan is "The Best or Nothing".</P>
