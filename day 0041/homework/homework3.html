     <p>Frontend Development is the creation of the web user-visible part of a page or application.
        The main technologies are:
          <li>HTML (structure),</li>
          <li>CSS (design),</li>
          <li>JavaScript (functional).</li>

            <h2>What is Frontend?</h2>
            <p>Frontend refers to the part of a website or application that users interact with directly.
                 It includes everything you see and use, such as buttons, menus, images, text, and animations.
                  The main goal of frontend development is to create a visually appealing,
                   responsive, and user-friendly interface.</p>

            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create the structure of a webpage.
                 It defines how a webpage is organized and what elements it contains, such as headings, text,
                  images, links, lists, and buttons.</p>
            <p><strong>Uses of HTML:</strong>
             <li>To build the structure of a website.</li>
             <li>To define visual elements (e.g., paragraphs, headings).</li>
             <li>To embed other technologies (CSS, JavaScript).</li>
             <li>To integrate links and multimedia (videos, audio).</li></p>

                <h3>history</h3>
                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he was working at CERN 
                    (European Organization for Nuclear Research).
                     It was designed to be a simple system for sharing documents over the internet and was a key component
                      in the development of the World Wide Web.</p>

            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to define the visual style of a webpage.
                 With CSS, you can modify the appearance of HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, layout, and other design aspects.</p>
                 <p><strong>Main Functions of CSS:</strong>
                    <li>Colors: Change text and background colors.</li>
                    <li>sizing: Set the size of elements, borders, and spacing.</li>
                    <li>Layout: Organize elements on the page, such as positioning menus or images.</li>
                    <li>Fonts: Control font style, size, and weight.</li>
                    <li>Responsive Design: Adjust the layout for different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).</li></p>

                <h3>history</h3>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was developed to provide better control over the presentation and design of web pages.
                     Prior to CSS, web designers had to rely on HTML alone to manage both structure and design,
                      which led to limitations in styling flexibility and efficiency.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic features to webpages.
                 It enables elements on a page to respond to user actions, such as clicking buttons, submitting forms, or scrolling.</p>
            <p>Key Features of JavaScript:
                <li>Interactivity: Responding to user actions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions).</li>
                <li>Dynamic Content: Changing or updating content on the page, such as refreshing lists or galleries.</li>
                <li>Minimal Server Requests: Fetching data from a server and updating the page without reloading (e.g., using AJAX).</li>
                <li>Multimedia Control: Managing videos and audio files.</li>
                <li>Client-side Validation: Checking and validating form data to prevent errors before submission.</li></p>

                <P>JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications Corporation.
                     He was tasked with developing a scripting language that could add interactivity to web pages, 
                     as websites at the time were primarily static and lacked user interaction.</P>
