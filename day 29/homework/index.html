     <h1>My addiction to Goa</h1>
     <p>Entering Goa was a great happiness for me because I wanted to study programming at a professional
         level and I was looking for a school where I was taught programming at a high level and I found Goa where learning 
         is very good and fun.At first, I was a little afraid, but when I got used to the space and made friends, 
         a greater need for learning arose As for the mentors, they are professionals in their field and do their best to teach you the material</p>
<P>Hackathons are also held once a month, which is very interesting and pleasant</P>
